# Javascript Framework

This project allowed me to test and create my own individual Javascript Framework applying what I learned about closures and prototypes. This specific exercise was taken from one of the many JavaScript courses I've taken by an instructor named Anthony Alicea.
This was also one of the first times using jQuery.
